        <h2>Why are girls falling behind in higher education?</h2>
        <h4>End early marriage and ensure their safety so they can reach full potential</h4>
        <p>While girls' enrolment in schools at the primary and secondary levels has been pretty good in recent years, the picture is quite different in case of college, degree and master's level education. According to latest data by the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (Banbeis), girls' enrolment rate starts falling at the college level, and the curve keeps dropping from there on.</p>
